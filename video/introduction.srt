1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,300
We get stressed, depressed...

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,300
There's a lot of confusing difficult emotions

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,700
and we don't really know how to deal with that

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,800
Our mind moves rapidly from one thing to another

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,400
without giving us any rest

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,400
There is more research everyday

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
showing us how much stress has gotten worse

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,100
over the last 20 to 30 years

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,100
It's time to take a break

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,500
Meditation and therapy gave me a greater appreciation

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,000
and understanding for the present moment

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,000
All you need to do

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,300
is to take a break

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,600
to step back

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,200
to familiarize yourself with the present moment

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,300
So that you get to experience a greater sense of

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,700
focus, calm and clarity in your life
