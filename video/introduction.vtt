We get stressed, depressed...

00:03.400 --> 00:06.300 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
There's a lot of confusing difficult emotions

00:06.400 --> 00:08.700 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
and we don't really know how to deal with that

00:08.800 --> 00:11.800 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
Our mind moves rapidly from one thing to another

00:11.900 --> 00:13.400 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
without giving us any rest

00:14.000 --> 00:16.400 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
There is more research everyday

00:16.500 --> 00:18.500 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
showing us how much stress has gotten worse

00:18.600 --> 00:20.100 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
over the last 20 to 30 years

00:20.500 --> 00:22.100 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
It's time to take a break

00:24.300 --> 00:27.500 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
Meditation and therapy gave me a greater appreciation

00:27.600 --> 00:30.000 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
and understanding for the present moment

00:30.700 --> 00:32.000 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
All you need to do

00:32.100 --> 00:34.600 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
is to take a break...to step back...

00:34.700 --> 00:37.200 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
to familiarize yourself with the present moment

00:37.300 --> 00:40.300 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
So that you get to experience a greater sense of

00:40.400 --> 00:44.700 line:7 position:50% align:center size:100%
focus, calm and clarity in your life
